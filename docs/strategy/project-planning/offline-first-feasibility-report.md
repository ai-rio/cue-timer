## üõ†Ô∏è Recommended Technical Architecture

### Core Technology Stack

```
Frontend: Next.js + PWA
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Service Worker: Workbox.js for caching and background sync
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Local Storage: IndexedDB (via idb library)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Real-time: WebSockets + Custom sync logic
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Backend: Supabase + PowerSync (for offline-first)

Alternative Stack (if PowerSync not viable):
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Custom sync engine with IndexedDB
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ WebSocket connection management
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Conflict resolution with CRDTs
```

### Key Implementation Components

#### 1. Timer State Management

```javascript
// Local-first timer state
const timerState = {
  currentTime: 0,
  isRunning: false,
  startTime: null,
  lastSyncTime: null,
  deviceId: uniqueDeviceId,
  sessionId: timerSessionId,
};
```

#### 2. Offline Queue System

```javascript
// Actions queued for sync when online
const syncQueue = [
  { type: 'TIMER_START', timestamp, deviceId, sessionId },
  { type: 'TIMER_STOP', timestamp, deviceId, sessionId },
  { type: 'TIMER_ADJUST', amount, timestamp, deviceId },
];
```

#### 3. Conflict Resolution Strategy

- **Timer Control**: Last-write-wins for start/stop actions
- **Time Adjustments**: Sum of all adjustments, applied in sequence
- **Session Management**: Creator device has priority for session controls

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Implementation Challenges & Mitigation Strategies

### Challenge 1: Data Consistency

**Risk**: Multiple devices making simultaneous changes create conflicts
**Mitigation**:

- Implement operational transformation (OT) or conflict-free replicated data
  types (CRDTs)
- Use device priority system for conflicting operations
- Provide visual indicators for sync status

### Challenge 2: Sync Performance

**Risk**: Large sync queues cause delays when reconnecting **Mitigation**:

- Batch sync operations
- Implement incremental sync with change detection
- Use compression for sync payloads
- Provide sync progress indicators

### Challenge 3: Storage Limits

**Risk**: IndexedDB storage quotas exceeded on long events **Mitigation**:

- Implement data rotation policies
- Compress historical timer data
- Use efficient data structures
- Clear old session data after configurable period

### Challenge 4: Battery Impact

**Risk**: Continuous sync drains device battery **Mitigation**:

- Implement adaptive sync intervals
- Use background sync API efficiently
- Optimize WebSocket usage
- Provide battery-saving modes

## üìä Performance Requirements & SLAs

   spike)
2. **Alternative Architecture**: Design custom sync solution if PowerSync not
   viable
3. **MVP Scope Decision**: Determine if offline-first is MVP or Phase 2 feature

### Recommended Implementation Approach

create table public.lists (
  id uuid not null default gen_random_uuid (),
  created_at timestamp with time zone not null default now(),
  name text not null,
  owner_id uuid not null,
  constraint lists_pkey primary key (id)

  id uuid not null default gen_random_uuid (),
  created_at timestamp with time zone not null default now(),
  description text not null,
  completed boolean not null default false,
  list_id uuid not null,
  constraint todos_list_id_fkey foreign key (list_id) references lists (id)
);

-- PowerSync Publication (enables real-time sync)
create publication powersync for table public.lists, public.todos;
```

#### Sync Rules (User-Isolated Timer Sessions)

```yaml
bucket_definitions:
  user_lists:
    # One bucket per user's timer sessions
    parameters:
      select id as list_id from lists where owner_id = request.user_id()
    data:
      - select * from lists where id = bucket.list_id
      - select * from todos where list_id = bucket.list_id
```
