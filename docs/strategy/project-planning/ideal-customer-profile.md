Let's brainstorm the ICP for CueTimer and then build a marketing narrative around it.

### Part 1: The Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

Our beachhead is not just "event managers." We need to get more specific. Let's create a persona.

**Persona Name: "The Precision Producer"**

This isn't just their job title; it's their mindset. They are responsible for the seamless execution of a live event, and their reputation is on the line with every minute that passes.

#### **Demographics:**
*   **Role:** Event Producer, Conference Coordinator, Worship Service Director, Technical Director, AV Manager.
*   **Experience:** 3-10 years in the industry. They've seen it all go wrong and are now actively looking for better systems, not just quick fixes.
*   **Company/Org Size:** Small-to-medium businesses (SMBs), non-profits, churches with 200+ attendees, or independent contractors working with corporate clients.

#### **Psychographics (The "Why"):**

**Their Deepest Pains (What keeps them up at night?):**
*   **The Speaker Runaway:** The #1 fear. A single speaker going 10 minutes over can derail the entire day, causing a domino effect of delays, cutting into lunch, and angering venue staff.
*   **The "Awkward Hand Signal":** The unprofessional, anxiety-inducing moment of having to give a speaker the "wrap it up" hand signal from the back of the room.
*   **Wi-Fi Anxiety:** The gut-wrenching feeling when the venue's Wi-Fi drops during a critical moment, knowing their timer and communication tools are now useless.
*   **Tool Juggling:** Frantically switching between a phone timer, a messaging app, and a presentation remote, looking like a octopus in a high-stakes situation.
*   **Guest Speaker Friction:** The hassle of getting a guest speaker to download an app, create an account, and figure out how to use it 5 minutes before they go on stage.

**Their Desired Gains (What does success look like?):**
*   **Calm Confidence:** The feeling of being in complete control, knowing the event is running on schedule, allowing them to focus on quality, not just timing.
*   **Looking Like a Hero:** The praise from a client or pastor who says, "That was the smoothest event we've ever had."
*   **Discreet Control:** The ability to manage the flow without distracting the audience or making the speaker uncomfortable.
*   **Effortless Onboarding:** A "wow" moment when a guest speaker is set up in under 10 seconds without any technical friction.
*   **Peace of Mind:** Knowing their system works even if the internet doesn't.

#### **Their "Watering Holes" (Where do they hang out?):**
*   **Online:** LinkedIn Groups (e.g., "Event Planners Association"), Reddit (r/churchtech, r/eventplanners), industry-specific forums (e.g., Church Production Magazine, Tech Manager Academy).
*   **Podcasts/Blogs:** They listen to podcasts like "The Event Planner Podcast" or read blogs from industry leaders.
*   **Tools:** They are familiar with professional software like Planning Center, ProPresenter, and Slack.

### Part 2: The Marketing Narrative - "From Chaos to Cue"

Now that we know who they are, we can craft a story that speaks directly to their pains and gains. We don't sell features; we sell a better reality.

**Core Message:**
> **CueTimer is the peace of mind that lets you focus on the message, not the minutes.**

**Value Proposition Pillars:**

1.  **Bulletproof Reliability:** "Our offline-first timer works even when the venue's Wi-Fi doesn't. Your schedule is safe with us." (Addresses Wi-Fi Anxiety)
2.  **Effortless Control:** "Manage the entire event flow from your phone. Start, stop, or adjust timers with a single tap." (Addresses Tool Juggling)
3.  **Seamless Professionalism:** "Elegantly cue your speakers without a single awkward gesture. Your events will look polished, professional, and perfectly timed." (Addresses The Awkward Hand Signal)

### Part 3: Brainstorming Marketing Channels & Tactics

Let's get specific about how we reach "The Precision Producer."

#### **Phase 1: Audience Building (The "Give, Give, Give" Approach)**

*   **Hyper-Valuable Content (Top of Funnel):**
    *   **The Ultimate Run-of-Show Template:** Create a beautiful, downloadable PDF or Google Sheets template for event planning. Promote it in all communities. This is pure value.
    *   **Blog Post:** "5 Tech Mistakes That Make Your Event Look Amateur (And How to Fix Them)." This uses a pain-point hook to provide genuine advice.
    *   **Video:** A 60-second screen recording showing the **QR Code Join** feature in action. No talking, just a clean demo of the magic. Post this on LinkedIn, Twitter, and in relevant forums.

*   **Community Engagement (Be a Human, Not a Billboard):**
    *   Go into r/churchtech and spend 30 minutes answering questions about live streaming or lighting. Build trust. *Then*, when someone asks about timing, you can genuinely recommend CueTimer.
    *   Find 10 event planners on LinkedIn who are posting about upcoming events. Leave a thoughtful comment: "Looks like a fantastic lineup! Managing all those speakers is a huge task. Best of luck with the run-of-show."

#### **Phase 2: The Launch (The "Ask")**

*   **The "Waitlist" Launch:** Email your waitlist with a compelling offer: "You helped us build CueTimer. Here's 50% off your first year of Pro."
*   **Micro-Influencer Partnerships:** Identify 5-10 "micro-influencers" in our beachhead (e.g., a church tech blogger with 5k followers, an event planning coach). Offer them a free lifetime Pro account in exchange for an honest review or a single social media post.
*   **Direct, Personalized Outreach:**
    *   **Target:** 50 conference organizers on LinkedIn.
    *   **Message:** "Hi [Name], I saw you're the force behind the [Conference Name]. I'm building a tool called CueTimer to solve the speaker-runaway problem that plagues so many events. Would you be open to a 15-minute chat about your current workflow? No strings attached."

### The "Aha!" Moment: The Core of Your Marketing

Everything in your marketing should lead to one moment: the **QR Code Join feature.**

This is your magic trick. It's the tangible proof of your value props.

**The Scenario to Paint:**
> "Your guest speaker arrives. They're nervous, their phone is at 10%, and they've never used your app before. You don't hand them a tablet and ask them to log in. You simply say, 'Scan this with your phone camera.' Instantly, a full-screen, beautiful timer appears. They're ready to go in 5 seconds. You look like a tech hero, and they feel completely taken care of."

This story is what people will share. It's the feature that will generate word-of-mouth. It must be the hero of your landing page, your demo videos, and your sales pitches.

By focusing on "The Precision Producer" and telling the "From Chaos to Cue" story, your marketing will resonate deeply, cut through the noise, and attract the exact customers you need to make CueTimer a success.
