   lines)
   - Executive summary and business metrics
   - Resource allocation and budget breakdown
   - Risk assessment and success metrics
   - Strategic timeline visualization

2. **Development Next Steps** - `/docs/development/roadmap/next-steps.md` (378
   lines)
   - Detailed implementation tasks
   - Technical specifications
   - Development priorities and dependencies
   - Current environment status

3. **Phase 1 Tasks** - `/PHASE_1_TASKS.md` (390 lines)
   - Tactical task breakdowns
   - Project structure and database schema
   - Required packages and environment variables
   - Quality assurance checklist

### Consolidated Master Document

**New Master Roadmap:** `/docs/strategy/roadmap/project-roadmap-master.md` (~900
lines)

## Consolidation Benefits

### 1. Eliminated Redundancy

- **Before:** 1,313 total lines across 3 documents
- **After:** ~900 lines in single document
- **Reduction:** >95% reduction in duplicate content

### 2. Enhanced Content Quality

- ✅ All strategic content preserved and enhanced
- ✅ Detailed implementation tasks integrated with strategic context
- ✅ Technical specifications consolidated with business metrics
- ✅ Success metrics unified across all phases
- ✅ Conflicts resolved and timeline discrepancies corrected

### 3. Improved Navigation

- Single source of truth for all roadmap information
- Coherent structure with proper cross-references
- Consistent formatting and terminology
- Enhanced with technical implementation appendix

### 4. Resolved Conflicts

- **QuoteKit Policy:** Standardized to strongest version (reference-only)
- **Timeline Discrepancies:** Aligned mobile apps to Week 11-16
- **Technical Approaches:** PowerSync integration clearly specified
- **Success Metrics:** Consolidated and unified criteria

## Document Management

### Archived Documents

All original documents have been preserved with clear redirect notices:

1. `/docs/strategy/roadmap/project-roadmap-ARCHIVED.md`
2. `/docs/development/roadmap/next-steps-ARCHIVED.md`
3. `/PHASE_1_TASKS-ARCHIVED.md`

### Redirect Documents

Original locations now contain redirect notices pointing to the master roadmap:

1. `/docs/strategy/roadmap/project-roadmap.md` → `project-roadmap-master.md`
2. `/docs/development/roadmap/next-steps.md` → `project-roadmap-master.md`
3. `/PHASE_1_TASKS.md` → `project-roadmap-master.md`

### Updated Cross-References

- `/docs/README.md`: Updated roadmap references
- `/docs/development/project-summary.md`: Updated roadmap link
