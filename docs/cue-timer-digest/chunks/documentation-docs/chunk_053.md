## 📘 Stage Timer App – **Refactored** Strategy Document

### **Guiding Principle: Beachhead & Data-Driven Expansion**

We will focus intensely on a single, high-value niche ("beachhead market") to
achieve product-market fit and initial traction, before expanding into adjacent
markets validated by our keyword research.

---

### 1. Market Context (Validated)

- **Existing tools:** Showtimer, Stagetimer.io, ProPresenter.
- **Gap:** A **low-complexity, mobile-first timer app** that’s reliable,
  offline-friendly, and monetizable.
- **✅ Validation:** Keyword research confirms this gap exists with high-intent,
  low-volume searches (`stage timer app`, `conference countdown timer`).

---

### 2. Niche Gaps & **Beachhead Strategy**

- **Primary Beachhead Market (Phase 1 Focus):** **Event Managers, Conference
  Organizers, & Worship Services.**
  - **Why:** High-intent keywords (`conference countdown timer`,
    `speaker timer app`) and clear workflow needs (Presenter/Controller views).
    This community is tight-knit, enabling word-of-mouth growth.
- **Secondary Expansion Market (Phase 3):** **Education & Productivity.**
  - **Why:** Massive search volume (`classroom timer app`,
    `pomodoro timer online`) proves a large adjacent market. We will attack this
    after solidifying our position in the beachhead.
- **De-prioritized Market:** **Esports.**
  - **Why:** Keyword research shows negligible search volume
    (`esports timer app`: 0-10), suggesting the market is too small or uses
    different terminology. We will park this idea until there is clear market
    signal.

---

### 3. Tech Stack (No Change)

- **Frontend:** Next.js (PWA).
- **Backend:** Supabase.
- **Mobile:** Capacitor.
- **Hosting:** Vercel / Supabase.

---

### 4. Architecture (No Change)

- **Track 1:** SEO Marketing Site (`yourapp.com`).
- **Track 2:** Mobile-First App (`app.yourapp.com`).
- **Shared Backend:** Supabase.

  messaging.
- **Team Tier ($20–50/mo):** Multi-user roles, templates, analytics.
- **Niche Add-Ons ($5–15/mo):** **Education Pack** first.
- **✅ Validation:** High CPC data for business-related keywords confirms
  commercial viability of Pro/Team tiers.

---

### 8. Go-to-Market Plan (Overhauled)

### **Phase 1: Audience First (Weeks 1-4)**

- **Launch a "Coming Soon" landing page** tailored to the beachhead market.
- **Offer a compelling incentive** (e.g., "50% off for life") to build an email
  waitlist.
- **Outreach to event managers, churches, schools** with the message: "We're
  building a timer to solve your exact problem. Want to be the first to know?"

### **Phase 2: Content-Driven Traction (Weeks 5-12)**

- **Publish blog posts targeting "Bridge Keywords":**
  - "The Ultimate Checklist for a Flawless Live Stream Service" (targets
    `live stream countdown timer`).
  - "How to Keep Your Keynote on Time: A Presenter's Guide" (targets
    `keynote presentation timer`).
- **Soft launch to the waitlist.** Gather intense feedback.

- **Public launch to app stores.**
- **Referral loop (“Invite a friend, get 1 month free”).**
- **Use SEO to target "Money Keywords"** (`stage timer app`,
  `conference countdown timer`) on your marketing site.

---

### 9. 90-Day Action Plan (Re-sequenced)

- **Week 1:** Launch waitlist landing page & start audience building outreach.
- **Weeks 2-5:** Build MVP (core timer, sync, **QR Code Join**).
- **Weeks 6-7:** Private Alpha with the waitlist. Get intense feedback.
- **Week 8:** Soft launch / Public Beta. Publish 2 niche-focused blog posts. Aim
  for 50-100 highly engaged beta users.
- **Week 9:** Submit to App Stores (review can take time).

  **Custom Branding**).
- **Week 11:** Public Launch! Announce to waitlist, communities, and launch the
  referral program.
- **Week 12:** Analyze initial data, talk to first paying customers, and plan
  the next Pro feature.

---

### 10. User Funnel (No Change)

1. Discovery → 2. Conversion → 3. Activation → 4. Retention → 5. Revenue → 6.
   Referral.

---

### 11. Keyword Research (Now a Core Driver)

- **Event niche (our beachhead):** `stage timer app`,
  `conference countdown timer`. **-> Used for SEO & ASO.**
- **Broad countdown (content bait):** `countdown app`, `event countdown app`.
  **-> Used for blog content.**
- **Education (our expansion):** `classroom timer app`, `study countdown timer`.
  **-> Informs Phase 3 features.**
- **Fitness (future exploration):** `tabata timer`, `HIIT workout timer`. **->
  Parked for now.**
- **Streaming/gaming (low priority):** `live stream countdown timer`. **-> Used
  for content, not product focus.**

---

### 12. Deployment Plan (Keyword-Specific)

- **SEO:** Target "Money Keywords" (`stage timer app`,
  `conference countdown timer`) on homepage. Target "Bridge Keywords"
  (`classroom timer`) on the blog.
- **ASO:** Use "Money Keywords" in the App Store title/subtitle. Use "Bridge
  Keywords" in the description.
- **Communities:** Focus on **event management and church tech groups** first.
  Fitness and education groups will be targeted later.

---

### 🎯 Final Summary of Changes

This refactored plan is more focused and less risky. We have:

1. **Chosen a Beachhead:** Concentrating our energy on the event/worship market
   to ensure a successful launch.
2. **Sequenced Our Actions:** Building an audience _before_ the product is ready
   to ensure we have customers on day one.
3. **Made Data-Driven Decisions:** Using keyword research to prioritize features
   (Custom Branding), validate pricing (Pro Tier), and choose our expansion
   market (Education over Esports).
4. **Added a "Magic" Feature:** The QR Code Join is a powerful, differentiator
   that directly addresses a key user friction point.

## File: `docs/strategy/project-planning/ideal-customer-profile.md`

```markdown
Excellent. Let's shift our focus from the "what" to the "who." A deep
understanding of the Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) is the bedrock of all great
marketing. It dictates your messaging, your channels, and your product itself.

Let's brainstorm the ICP for CueTimer and then build a marketing narrative
around it.

---

### Part 1: The Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

Our beachhead is not just "event managers." We need to get more specific. Let's
create a persona.

**Persona Name: "The Precision Producer"**

This isn't just their job title; it's their mindset. They are responsible for
the seamless execution of a live event, and their reputation is on the line with
every minute that passes.

#### **Demographics:**

- **Role:** Event Producer, Conference Coordinator, Worship Service Director,
  Technical Director, AV Manager.
- **Experience:** 3-10 years in the industry. They've seen it all go wrong and
  are now actively looking for better systems, not just quick fixes.
- **Company/Org Size:** Small-to-medium businesses (SMBs), non-profits, churches
  with 200+ attendees, or independent contractors working with corporate
  clients.

#### **Psychographics (The "Why"):**

**Their Deepest Pains (What keeps them up at night?):**

- **The Speaker Runaway:** The #1 fear. A single speaker going 10 minutes over
  can derail the entire day, causing a domino effect of delays, cutting into
  lunch, and angering venue staff.
- **The "Awkward Hand Signal":** The unprofessional, anxiety-inducing moment of
  having to give a speaker the "wrap it up" hand signal from the back of the
  room.
- **Wi-Fi Anxiety:** The gut-wrenching feeling when the venue's Wi-Fi drops
  during a critical moment, knowing their timer and communication tools are now
  useless.
- **Tool Juggling:** Frantically switching between a phone timer, a messaging
  app, and a presentation remote, looking like a octopus in a high-stakes
  situation.
- **Guest Speaker Friction:** The hassle of getting a guest speaker to download
  an app, create an account, and figure out how to use it 5 minutes before they
  go on stage.

**Their Desired Gains (What does success look like?):**

- **Calm Confidence:** The feeling of being in complete control, knowing the
  event is running on schedule, allowing them to focus on quality, not just
  timing.
- **Looking Like a Hero:** The praise from a client or pastor who says, "That
  was the smoothest event we've ever had."
- **Discreet Control:** The ability to manage the flow without distracting the
  audience or making the speaker uncomfortable.
- **Effortless Onboarding:** A "wow" moment when a guest speaker is set up in
  under 10 seconds without any technical friction.
- **Peace of Mind:** Knowing their system works even if the internet doesn't.

#### **Their "Watering Holes" (Where do they hang out?):**

- **Online:** LinkedIn Groups (e.g., "Event Planners Association"), Reddit
  (r/churchtech, r/eventplanners), industry-specific forums (e.g., Church
  Production Magazine, Tech Manager Academy).
- **Podcasts/Blogs:** They listen to podcasts like "The Event Planner Podcast"
  or read blogs from industry leaders.
- **Tools:** They are familiar with professional software like Planning Center,
  ProPresenter, and Slack.

### Part 2: The Marketing Narrative - "From Chaos to Cue"

Now that we know who they are, we can craft a story that speaks directly to
their pains and gains. We don't sell features; we sell a better reality.

**Core Message:**

> **CueTimer is the peace of mind that lets you focus on the message, not the
> minutes.**

**Value Proposition Pillars:**

1.  **Bulletproof Reliability:** "Our offline-first timer works even when the
    venue's Wi-Fi doesn't. Your schedule is safe with us." (Addresses Wi-Fi
    Anxiety)
2.  **Effortless Control:** "Manage the entire event flow from your phone.
    Start, stop, or adjust timers with a single tap." (Addresses Tool Juggling)
3.  **Seamless Professionalism:** "Elegantly cue your speakers without a single
    awkward gesture. Your events will look polished, professional, and perfectly
    timed." (Addresses The Awkward Hand Signal)

---

### Part 3: Brainstorming Marketing Channels & Tactics

Let's get specific about how we reach "The Precision Producer."

#### **Phase 1: Audience Building (The "Give, Give, Give" Approach)**

- **Hyper-Valuable Content (Top of Funnel):**
  - **The Ultimate Run-of-Show Template:** Create a beautiful, downloadable PDF
    or Google Sheets template for event planning. Promote it in all communities.
    This is pure value.
  - **Blog Post:** "5 Tech Mistakes That Make Your Event Look Amateur (And How
    to Fix Them)." This uses a pain-point hook to provide genuine advice.
  - **Video:** A 60-second screen recording showing the **QR Code Join** feature
    in action. No talking, just a clean demo of the magic. Post this on
    LinkedIn, Twitter, and in relevant forums.

- **Community Engagement (Be a Human, Not a Billboard):**
  - Go into r/churchtech and spend 30 minutes answering questions about live
    streaming or lighting. Build trust. _Then_, when someone asks about timing,
    you can genuinely recommend CueTimer.
  - Find 10 event planners on LinkedIn who are posting about upcoming events.
    Leave a thoughtful comment: "Looks like a fantastic lineup! Managing all
    those speakers is a huge task. Best of luck with the run-of-show."

#### **Phase 2: The Launch (The "Ask")**

- **The "Waitlist" Launch:** Email your waitlist with a compelling offer: "You
  helped us build CueTimer. Here's 50% off your first year of Pro."
- **Micro-Influencer Partnerships:** Identify 5-10 "micro-influencers" in our
  beachhead (e.g., a church tech blogger with 5k followers, an event planning
  coach). Offer them a free lifetime Pro account in exchange for an honest
  review or a single social media post.
- **Direct, Personalized Outreach:**
  - **Target:** 50 conference organizers on LinkedIn.
  - **Message:** "Hi [Name], I saw you're the force behind the [Conference
    Name]. I'm building a tool called CueTimer to solve the speaker-runaway
    problem that plagues so many events. Would you be open to a 15-minute chat
    about your current workflow? No strings attached."

---

### The "Aha!" Moment: The Core of Your Marketing

Everything in your marketing should lead to one moment: the **QR Code Join
feature.**

This is your magic trick. It's the tangible proof of your value props.

**The Scenario to Paint:**

> "Your guest speaker arrives. They're nervous, their phone is at 10%, and
> they've never used your app before. You don't hand them a tablet and ask them
> to log in. You simply say, 'Scan this with your phone camera.' Instantly, a
> full-screen, beautiful timer appears. They're ready to go in 5 seconds. You
> look like a tech hero, and they feel completely taken care of."

This story is what people will share. It's the feature that will generate
word-of-mouth. It must be the hero of your landing page, your demo videos, and
your sales pitches.

By focusing on "The Precision Producer" and telling the "From Chaos to Cue"
story, your marketing will resonate deeply, cut through the noise, and attract
the exact customers you need to make CueTimer a success.
